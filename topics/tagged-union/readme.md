# Tagged Union

> A tagged union, also called a variant, variant record, choice type, discriminated union, disjoint union, or sum type, is a data structure used to hold a value that could take on several different, but fixed, types. Only one of the types can be in use at any one time, and a tag field explicitly indicates which one is in use. It can be thought of as a type that has several "cases," each of which should be handled correctly when that type is manipulated. [[0]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union)
